        <p>I am Osunsanya Agbolade Bolarinwa. I am currently a school teacher looking to transition into tech. Hence, I felt enrolling for a Front end engineering course at Altschool would be a good idea or would help me achieve this goal.</p>
        <p>My Altschool student ID number is ALT/SOE/023/3800.</p>
        <p>I hope that at the end of the session I would have achieved my set goal of being a Front-end software developer. The ultimate goal is to acquire technical skills that will make me competitive in the job market given that tech skills are high demand skills.</p>
